## LangString Library

The LangString Library emerges as a solution to the intricate challenge of handling multilingual text in software applications. In today's globalized world, where digital platforms often cater to a diverse, multilingual audience, the need for efficiently managing text in multiple languages is paramount. This library is motivated by the necessity to simplify the representation, storage, and manipulation of language-specific text data, thereby addressing a common problem in internationalized applications.

### Purpose and Contextualization

The primary purpose of the LangString Library is to provide developers with robust tools for handling text in different languages, ensuring accurate and efficient processing of multilingual content. It aims to bridge the gap between the complexities of language-specific text management and the growing demand for applications that can seamlessly operate across linguistic boundaries.

### Key Components

The library comprises two main classes, each serving distinct roles in the realm of multilingual text management:

- **LangString**: This class encapsulates a single string along with its language information. It is ideal for scenarios where individual text strings are tied to specific languages, such as user-generated content in different languages or displaying messages in a user's preferred language.

- **MultiLangString**: This class, on the other hand, is designed for handling text strings across multiple languages. It is particularly useful in applications that need to store and display the same content in several languages, like multilingual websites or global e-commerce platforms.

### Practical Use Cases

- **LangString Use Case**: In a multilingual customer support system, LangString can be used to store user queries in their original language, facilitating accurate translation and response by support staff.

- **MultiLangString Use Case**: For a global marketing campaign, MultiLangString can manage promotional content in various languages, enabling the campaign to resonate with a diverse international audience.

In essence, the LangString Library is a strategic response to the challenges of modern, multilingual application development, offering essential tools for seamless and effective language-specific text handling.

### Related Work and Differences

The LangString Library offers unique functionalities for handling multilingual text in Python applications. While there are several libraries and tools available for internationalization, localization, and language processing, they differ from the LangString Library in scope and functionality. Below is an overview of related work and how they compare to the LangString Library:

- **Babel**
    - https://pypi.org/project/Babel/
    - Babel is a Python library for internationalization and localization. It primarily focuses on formatting dates, numbers, and currency values for different locales.
    - Difference: Unlike Babel, the LangString Library specifically manages multilingual text strings, providing a more direct approach to handling language-specific text data.

- **gettext**
    - https://pypi.org/project/python-gettext/
    - gettext is a GNU system used for internationalizing applications. It allows for translating fixed strings in different languages using message catalogs.
    - Difference: The LangString Library, in contrast, is designed for dynamic management of multilingual content, not just for translation of static strings.

- **langcodes**
    - https://pypi.org/project/langcodes/
    - langcodes provides tools for parsing and understanding language tags.
    - Difference: While langcodes is useful for handling language codes, the LangString Library extends beyond this by managing actual multilingual text strings associated with these codes.

- **Polyglot**
    - https://pypi.org/project/polyglot/
    - Polyglot is a natural language pipeline that supports multiple languages for various NLP tasks.
    - Difference: Polyglot focuses on language processing rather than the structured management of multilingual text, which is the core functionality of the LangString Library.

- **CLD3**
    - https://pypi.org/project/gcld3/
    - Google's CLD3 is a model for language identification.
    - Difference: CLD3 is specialized in detecting the language of a text, whereas the LangString Library is about storing and manipulating text in multiple languages.

    - https://pypi.org/project/spacy/
    - spaCy is a comprehensive NLP library that supports multiple languages.
    - Difference: spaCy is geared towards analyzing text, not managing it. The LangString Library, on the other hand, is designed for the structured handling and storage of multilingual text.

In summary, while these related tools and libraries offer valuable functionalities for internationalization, localization, and language processing, the LangString Library stands out for its specific focus on managing and manipulating multilingual text strings in a structured and efficient manner.

### Installation and Use

Install with:

```bash
pip install langstring
```

Then, encapsulate strings with their language tags as shown in the examples above.

After installation, you can use the `LangString` and `MultiLangString` classes in your project. Simply import the classes and start encapsulating strings with their language tags.

```python
from langstring import LangString, MultiLangString, LangStringControl, LangStringFlag, MultiLangStringControl, MultiLangStringFlag
```

## LangStrings

The `LangString` class is a fundamental component of the LangString Library, designed to encapsulate a single string along with its associated language information. It is primarily used in scenarios where the language context of a text string is crucial, such as in multilingual applications, content management systems, or any software that deals with language-specific data. The class provides a structured way to manage text strings, ensuring that each piece of text is correctly associated with its respective language.

### LangStringsâ€™ Methods

The `LangString` class offers a range of methods to efficiently handle language-specific text. These methods enable the initialization, representation, comparison, and validation of text strings in their language context.

#### `__init__` Method

**Description**:
The `__init__` method initializes a new LangString object. It accepts `text`, the string to be encapsulated, and an optional `lang` parameter, which is the language tag associated with the text. This method is essential for creating LangString instances, tying the text to its language context.

**Examples**:

- Creating a LangString instance without a language tag

```python
greeting = LangString("Hello")
```

- Creating a LangString instance with a language tag

```python
french_greeting = LangString("Bonjour", "fr")
```

#### `to_string` Method

**Description**:
The `to_string` method converts the LangString object into a string representation, including the language tag if present. This method is useful for displaying or logging the content of a LangString object in a human-readable format.

**Examples**:

```python
greeting = LangString("Hello", "en")
print(greeting.to_string())  # Output: '"Hello"@en'
```

#### `__str__` Method

**Description**:
The `__str__` method defines how a LangString object is converted to a string, typically used when the object is printed. It returns the text string, optionally followed by the language tag.

**Examples**:

```python
greeting = LangString("Hello", "en")
print(greeting)  # Output: '"Hello"@en'
```

#### `__eq__` Method

**Description**:
The `__eq__` method checks the equality of the LangString object with another object. It compares both the text and the language tag to determine if two LangString objects are the same.

**Examples**:

- Comparing two LangString instances

```python
greeting_en1 = LangString("Hello", "en")
greeting_en2 = LangString("Hello", "en")
print(greeting_en1 == greeting_en2)  # Output: True
```

- Comparing LangString instances with different texts or languages

```python
greeting_es = LangString("Hola", "es")
print(greeting_en1 == greeting_es)  # Output: False
```

#### `__hash__` Method

**Description**:
The `__hash__` method generates a hash value for the LangString object. This is particularly useful when LangString objects need to be used in hash-based collections like sets or dictionaries.

**Examples**:

```python
greeting = LangString("Hello", "en")
print(hash(greeting))
```

## MultiLangStrings

The `MultiLangString` class is a key component of the LangString Library, designed to manage and manipulate text strings across multiple languages. This class is particularly useful in applications that require handling of text in a multilingual context, such as websites, applications with internationalization support, and data processing tools that deal with multilingual data. The primary purpose of `MultiLangString` is to store, retrieve, and manipulate text entries in various languages, offering a flexible and efficient way to handle multilingual content.

### MultiLangStringsâ€™ Methods

The `MultiLangString` class provides a suite of methods to facilitate the management of multilingual text. These methods enable the addition, removal, retrieval, and manipulation of text entries in multiple languages, as well as setting and getting a preferred language for default text retrieval.

#### `__init__`

The `__init__` method initializes a new MultiLangString object. It accepts an optional dictionary (`mls_dict`) representing the internal structure of the MultiLangString, where keys are language codes and values are sets of text entries. It also accepts a `pref_lang` parameter for setting the preferred language.

**Examples**:

- Initializing with a dictionary:

```python
mls = MultiLangString({"en": {"Hello", "Good morning"}})
```

- Initializing with a preferred language

```python
mls = MultiLangString(pref_lang="en")
```

#### `add_entry`

The `add_entry` method adds a text entry to the MultiLangString under a specified language. It ensures that the text and language comply with the set control flags.

**Examples**:

- Adding an entry

```python
# Initialize MultiLangString with multiple languages
mls = MultiLangString({"en": {"Hello", "Good morning"}, "es": {"Hola", "Buenos dÃ­as"}})

# Add a new entry in French
mls.add_entry("Bonjour", "fr")
print(mls.get_strings_all())  # Output: ['Hello', 'Good morning', 'Hola', 'Buenos dÃ­as', 'Bonjour']
```

#### `add_langstring`

This method adds a LangString object to the MultiLangString, allowing for the integration of LangString instances directly.

**Examples**:

- Adding a LangString

```python
mls.add_langstring(LangString("Hola", "es"))
```

#### `remove_entry`

The `remove_entry` method removes a specific text entry from a given language in the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Removing an entry

```python
mls.remove_entry("Hello", "en")
```

#### `remove_lang`

This method removes all entries of a given language from the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Removing a language

```python
mls = MultiLangString({"en": {"Hello", "Good morning"}, "es": {"Hola", "Buenos dÃ­as"}, "fr": {"Bonjour"}})

# Remove an entry in English
mls.remove_entry("Good morning", "en")
print(mls.get_strings_lang("en"))  # Output: ['Hello']
```

- Removing a language's last entry

```python
mls.remove_entry("Hello", "en")
print("en" in mls.mls_dict)  # Output: False (The key 'en' is no longer in the dictionary)
```

In `MultiLangString`, when the last entry of a specific language is removed using the `remove_entry` method, the key corresponding to that language is also removed from the internal dictionary (`mls_dict`). This behavior ensures that the dictionary only contains languages with at least one text entry.

#### `get_langstring`

The `get_langstring` method retrieves a LangString object for a specific text and language combination from the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Retrieving a LangString

```python
lang_str = mls.get_langstring("Hello", "en")
```

#### `get_langstrings_lang`

This method retrieves a list of LangStrings for a given language from the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Retrieving LangStrings for a language

```python
lang_strings = mls.get_langstrings_lang("en")
```

#### `get_langstrings_all`

The `get_langstrings_all` method retrieves a list of all LangStrings in the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Retrieving all LangStrings

```python
all_lang_strings = mls.get_langstrings_all()
```

#### `get_langstrings_pref_lang`

This method retrieves a list of LangStrings for the preferred language set in the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Retrieving LangStrings for the preferred language

```python
pref_lang_strings = mls.get_langstrings_pref_lang()
```

#### `get_strings_lang`

The `get_strings_lang` method retrieves all text entries for a specific language from the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Retrieving text entries for a language

```python
texts = mls.get_strings_lang("en")
```

#### `get_strings_pref_lang`

This method retrieves all text entries for the preferred language in the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Retrieving text entries for the preferred language

```python
pref_texts = mls.get_strings_pref_lang()
```

#### `get_strings_all`

The `get_strings_all` method retrieves all text entries across all languages in the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Retrieving all text entries

```python
all_texts = mls.get_strings_all()
```

#### `get_strings_langstring_lang`

This method retrieves all text entries for a specific language, formatted as '"text"@lang', from the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Retrieving formatted text entries for a language

```python
formatted_texts = mls.get_strings_langstring_lang("en")
```

#### `get_strings_langstring_pref_lang`

The `get_strings_langstring_pref_lang` method retrieves all text entries for the preferred language, formatted as '"text"@lang'.

**Examples**:

- Retrieving formatted text entries for the preferred language

```python
formatted_pref_texts = mls.get_strings_langstring_pref_lang()
```

#### `get_strings_langstring_all`

This method retrieves all text entries across all languages, formatted as '"text"@lang', in the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Retrieving all formatted text entries

```python
all_formatted_texts = mls.get_strings_langstring_all()
```

#### `len_entries_all`

The `len_entries_all` method calculates the total number of text entries across all languages in the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Getting the total number of entries

```python
total_entries = mls.len_entries_all()
```

#### `len_entries_lang`

This method calculates the number of text entries for a specific language in the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Getting the number of entries for a language

```python
num_entries = mls.len_entries_lang("en")
```

#### `len_langs`

The `len_langs` method calculates the number of distinct languages represented in the MultiLangString.

**Examples**:

- Getting the number of languages

```python
num_languages = mls.len_langs()
```

#### `__repr__`

The `__repr__` method returns a detailed string representation of the MultiLangString object, including the full dictionary of language strings and the preferred language.

**Examples**:

- Printing the representation

```python
print(mls.__repr__())
```

#### `__str__`

The `__str__` method defines the string representation of the MultiLangString, listing each text entry with its associated language tag.

**Examples**:

- Printing the MultiLangString

```python
print(mls)
```

#### `__eq__`

The `__eq__` method checks the equality of the MultiLangString object with another object based on the `mls_dict` attribute.

**Examples**:

- Comparing two MultiLangStrings

```python
# Create two MultiLangString instances with the same content but different preferred languages
mls1 = MultiLangString({"en": {"Hello", "Good morning"}, "es": {"Hola", "Buenos dÃ­as"}}, pref_lang="en")
mls2 = MultiLangString({"en": {"Hello", "Good morning"}, "es": {"Hola", "Buenos dÃ­as"}}, pref_lang="es")

# Despite having different preferred languages, they are considered equal because their content (mls_dict) is the same
print(mls1 == mls2)  # Output: True

# Change the content of mls2
mls2.add_entry("Bonjour", "fr")

# Now mls1 and mls2 are not equal because their content differs
print(mls1 == mls2)  # Output: False
```

#### `__hash__`

The `__hash__` method generates a hash value for the MultiLangString object based on its `mls_dict` attribute.

**Examples**:

- Generating a hash value

```python
print(hash(mls))
```

## Control and Flags

The Control and Flags system in the LangString Library plays a pivotal role in managing and configuring the behavior of `LangString` and `MultiLangString` instances.

This system operates at a global, class-level context, meaning that the flags and controls applied have a uniform effect across all instances of these classes. In other words, when a flag is set or reset using the control classes, it impacts every instance of `LangString` and `MultiLangString` throughout the application. This ensures consistent behavior and validation rules across all instances, as individual instances cannot have differing flag values.

In the following subsections, we will delve into the specifics of the available flags and the control methods. The flags define key aspects of how `LangString` and `MultiLangString` instances handle multilingual text, including validation rules and representation formats. Understanding these flags is crucial for effectively utilizing the library in various scenarios, especially those involving multilingual content.

The control methods, shared between `LangStringControl` and `MultiLangStringControl`, provide the mechanisms to set, retrieve, and reset these flags. These methods ensure that you can dynamically configure the behavior of the library to suit your application's needs. We will explore each method in detail, providing insights into their usage and impact on the library's functionality.

### Flags

The LangString and MultiLangString classes use a set of flags to control various aspects of their behavior. These flags are managed by `LangStringControl` and `MultiLangStringControl` respectively. The available flags and their effects are as follows:

#### `ENSURE_TEXT`
- **Description**: This flag ensures that the text provided to `LangString` or `MultiLangString` is not empty.
- **Effect**: When set to `True`, attempting to create a `LangString` or add an entry to `MultiLangString` with an empty string will raise a `ValueError`. This is useful for enforcing the presence of meaningful content.
- **Default Value**: `True`. By default, the library requires that text strings are not empty.


#### `ENSURE_ANY_LANG`
- **Description**: This flag mandates the presence of a language tag in `LangString` or `MultiLangString`.
- **Effect**: If `True`, a `ValueError` is raised when a `LangString` is created or an entry is added to `MultiLangString` without a language tag. This flag is beneficial for scenarios where language context is crucial.
- **Default Value**: `False`. By default, the library does not require a language tag to be present.


#### `ENSURE_VALID_LANG`
- **Description**: This flag ensures that the language tags used in `LangString` or `MultiLangString` are valid according to standard language codes (e.g., ISO 639-1).
- **Effect**: When enabled, creating a `LangString` or adding an entry to `MultiLangString` with an invalid language tag results in a `ValueError`. This flag is essential for maintaining consistency and accuracy in language-specific data.
- **Default Value**: `False`. By default, the library does not enforce the validity of language tags.

These flags provide a flexible way to customize the behavior of `LangString` and `MultiLangString` classes according to the specific needs of your application. By adjusting these flags, you can enforce different levels of validation and control over the language data being processed.

### Example Usage of Flags

```python
from langstring import LangString, LangStringControl, LangStringFlag

# Enabling the ENSURE_TEXT flag
LangStringControl.set_flag(LangStringFlag.ENSURE_TEXT, True)

# Attempting to create a LangString with an empty string will now raise an error
try:
    lang_str = LangString("")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # Outputs an error message
```

These flags provide a flexible way to customize the behavior of `LangString` and `MultiLangString` classes according to the specific needs of your application. By adjusting these flags, you can enforce different levels of validation and control over the language data being processed.

### Control

The Control classes, namely `LangStringControl` and `MultiLangStringControl`, act as static managers for the flags. They provide methods to set, retrieve, and reset the states of these flags, ensuring consistent behavior across all instances of `LangString` and `MultiLangString`.

#### Control Methods

##### `set_flag`

The `set_flag` method is used to enable or disable a specific flag for either LangString or MultiLangString. This method allows for dynamic configuration of behavior, such as enforcing non-empty text or valid language tags.

**Examples**:

- Enabling the ENSURE_TEXT flag for LangString:
  ```python
  LangStringControl.set_flag(LangStringFlag.ENSURE_TEXT, True)
  ```
- Disabling the ENSURE_VALID_LANG flag for MultiLangString:
  ```python
  MultiLangStringControl.set_flag(MultiLangStringFlag.ENSURE_VALID_LANG, False)
  ```

##### `get_flag`

The `get_flag` method retrieves the current state (enabled or disabled) of a specified flag. It is useful for checking the configuration status of LangString or MultiLangString instances.

**Examples**:

- Checking if ENSURE_TEXT is enabled for LangString:
  ```python
  is_text_ensured = LangStringControl.get_flag(LangStringFlag.ENSURE_TEXT)
  print(is_text_ensured)  # Output: True or False
  ```
- Checking if ENSURE_VALID_LANG is enabled for MultiLangString:
  ```python
  is_valid_lang_enforced = MultiLangStringControl.get_flag(MultiLangStringFlag.ENSURE_VALID_LANG)
  print(is_valid_lang_enforced)  # Output: True or False
  ```

##### `reset_flags`

The `reset_flags` method resets all flags to their default values. This is particularly useful for restoring the default behavior after temporary changes to the configuration flags.

**Examples**:

- Resetting all flags for LangString:
  ```python
  LangStringControl.reset_flags()
  ```
- Resetting all flags for MultiLangString:
  ```python
  MultiLangStringControl.reset_flags()
  ```

##### `print_flags`

The `print_flags` method prints the current state of all configuration flags to the console. It is a convenient tool for debugging or monitoring the current flag settings.

**Examples**:

- Printing all flags for LangString:
  ```python
  LangStringControl.print_flags()
  ```
- Printing all flags for MultiLangString:
  ```python
  MultiLangStringControl.print_flags()
  ```

This section provides an overview of the control and flag system in the LangString Library, including how to use the control classes and their methods to manage the behavior of LangString and MultiLangString instances. The examples illustrate practical use cases for these methods.

### LangString Control Examples

```python
from langstring import LangString, LangStringControl, LangStringFlag

# Example: Enabling the ENSURE_TEXT flag
LangStringControl.set_flag(LangStringFlag.ENSURE_TEXT, True)

# Trying to create a LangString with an empty string (will raise ValueError due to ENSURE_TEXT)
try:
    empty_string_lang = LangString("")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

# Checking if the ENSURE_TEXT flag is enabled
is_ensure_text_enabled = LangStringControl.get_flag(LangStringFlag.ENSURE_TEXT)
print(f"ENSURE_TEXT flag is enabled: {is_ensure_text_enabled}")

# Resetting all flags to default
LangStringControl.reset_flags()
```

### MultiLangString Control Examples

```python
from langstring import MultiLangString, MultiLangStringControl, MultiLangStringFlag

# Example: Disabling the ENSURE_VALID_LANG flag
MultiLangStringControl.set_flag(MultiLangStringFlag.ENSURE_VALID_LANG, False)

# Creating a MultiLangString instance with an invalid language code (no error due to flag being disabled)
mls = MultiLangString({"xx": {"Hello"}})
print(f"Created MultiLangString: {mls}")

## Version 2: Key Differences and Improvements

The LangString Library has undergone significant enhancements from Version 1 (V1) to Version 2 (V2). These changes have improved the library's functionality and usability, particularly in terms of control mechanisms and handling multilingual strings. Below are the key differences and improvements:

- Global Control Availability
    - **V1**: Global control was not available for both `LangString` and `MultiLangString`.
    - **V2**: Global control has been introduced for both `LangString` and `MultiLangString`, allowing for more flexible and centralized management of behavior across all instances.

- Individual Level Control
    - **V1**: Individual level control was only available for `MultiLangString`, with no control options for `LangString`.
    - **V2**: Both `LangString` and `MultiLangString` now have global control capabilities, enhancing consistency and ease of configuration.

- Handling of Multilingual Strings
    - **V1**: `MultiLangString` was designed to handle a single string associated with multiple languages, allowing for synonyms.
    - **V2**: The internal structure of `MultiLangString` has been rebuilt. It now handles multiple strings associated with multiple languages, still allowing for synonyms. This change provides more versatility in managing multilingual content.

- Method Restructuring in MultiLangString
    - **V2**: Methods in `MultiLangString` have been restructured, offering more options and improved functionality in v2 compared to v1.

- Dependency Between MultiLangString and LangString
    - **V1**: `MultiLangStrings` were entirely dependent on `LangStrings`.
    - **V2**: This dependency has been removed. `MultiLangString` now operates independently of `LangString`, providing more flexibility and reducing coupling between these two components.

These improvements in v2 of the LangString Library mark a significant step forward in its capability to handle multilingual text data, offering users more control and flexibility in their applications.
