# LangString Python Library

LangString is a Python library designed to handle multilingual text data with precision and flexibility. Although the need for robust management of multilingual content is critical, existing solutions often lack the necessary features to manage language-tagged strings, sets of strings, and collections of multilingual strings effectively. LangString addresses this gap by providing classes and utilities that enable the creation, manipulation, and validation of multilingual text data consistently and accurately. Inspired by [RDFS's langstrings](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/), LangString integrates seamlessly into Python applications, offering familiar methods that mimic those of regular Python types, making it intuitive for developers to adopt and use.

**ðŸ“¦ PyPI Package:**
The library is conveniently [available as a PyPI package](https://pypi.org/project/langstring/), allowing users to easily import it into other Python projects.

**ðŸ“š Documentation:**
For detailed documentation and code examples, please refer to the library's [docstring-generated documentation](https://pedropaulofb.github.io/langstring).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pedropaulofb/langstring.git
cd langstring
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will clone the repository, navigate into the project directory, and install all the necessary packages needed for development.

### Importing Elements

After installation, you can use the following elements in your project: LangString, SetLangString, MultiLangString, Controller, GlobalFlag, LangStringFlag, SetLangStringFlag, MultiLangStringFlag, and Converter.

To import these elements, use the following import statement:

```python
from langstring import LangString, SetLangString, MultiLangString, Controller, GlobalFlag, LangStringFlag, SetLangStringFlag, MultiLangStringFlag, Converter
```

### Basic Usage

1. **LangString** is used to handle a string in a specific language.

   ```python
   from langstring import LangString

   # Create a LangString object
   lang_str = LangString("Hello, World!", "en")

   # Print the string representation
   print(lang_str)  # Output: "Hello, World!"@en
   ```

2. **SetLangString** allows you to handle a set of strings in a specific language.

   ```python
   from langstring import SetLangString

   # Create a SetLangString object
   set_lang_str = SetLangString({"Hello", "Hi"}, "en")

   # Print the set of strings
   print(set_lang_str)  # Output: {'Hello', 'Hi'}@en
   ```

3. **MultiLangString** manages strings in multiple languages.

   ```python
   from langstring import MultiLangString

   # Create a MultiLangString object
   multi_lang_str = MultiLangString({"en": {"Hello", "Hi"}, "es": {"Hola"}})

   # Print the multilingual string representation
   print(multi_lang_str)  # Output: en: {'Hello', 'Hi'}, es: {'Hola'}
   ```

4. **Controller** and **Flags** are used to manage global and specific language string states.

   ```python
   from langstring import Controller, GlobalFlag

   # Set a flag
   Controller.set_flag(GlobalFlag.LOWERCASE_LANG, True)

   # Print the state of a specific flag
   Controller.print_flag(GlobalFlag.LOWERCASE_LANG)  # Output: GlobalFlag.LOWERCASE_LANG = True
   ```

5. **Converter** is used to convert language strings between different formats.

   ```python
   from langstring import Converter, LangString, SetLangString, MultiLangString

   # Convert a string to a LangString using the 'manual' method
   langstring = Converter.from_string_to_langstring("manual", "Hello", "en")
   print(langstring)  # Output: "Hello"@en

   # Convert a list of strings to a list of LangStrings using the 'parse' method
   langstrings = Converter.from_strings_to_langstrings("parse", ["Hello@en", "Bonjour@fr"], separator="@")
   for ls in langstrings:
       print(ls)  # Output: "Hello"@en
                  #         "Bonjour"@fr
   ```


## Library Reference

### Classes

#### LangStrings

The LangString class is a fundamental component of the LangString Library, designed to encapsulate a single string along with its associated language information. It is primarily used in scenarios where the language context of a text string is crucial, such as in multilingual applications, content management systems, or any software that deals with language-specific data. The class provides a structured way to manage text strings, ensuring that each piece of text is correctly associated with its respective language.

In the LangString class, the string representation format varies based on the presence of a language tag. When a language tag is provided, the format is `text`. Without a language tag, it is formatted as `"text"@lang`, where lang is the language code.

- [Documentation](https://pedropaulofb.github.io/langstring/autoapi/langstring/setlangstring/)

#### MultiLangStrings

The `MultiLangString` class is a key component of the LangString Library, designed to manage and manipulate text strings across multiple languages. This class is particularly useful in applications that require handling of text in a multilingual context, such as websites, applications with internationalization support, and data processing tools that deal with multilingual data. The primary purpose of `MultiLangString` is to store, retrieve, and manipulate text entries in various languages, offering a flexible and efficient way to handle multilingual content.

- [Documentation](https://pedropaulofb.github.io/langstring/autoapi/langstring/multilangstring/)

#### Controller

The Control and Flags system in the LangString Library plays a pivotal role in managing and configuring the behavior of LangString and `MultiLangString` instances.

This system operates at a global, class-level context, meaning that the flags and controls applied have a uniform effect across all instances of these classes. In other words, when a flag is set or reset using the control classes, it impacts every instance of LangString and `MultiLangString` throughout the application. This ensures consistent behavior and validation rules across all instances, as individual instances cannot have differing flag values.

In the following subsections, we will delve into the specifics of the available flags and the control methods. The flags define key aspects of how LangString and `MultiLangString` instances handle multilingual text, including validation rules and representation formats. Understanding these flags is crucial for effectively utilizing the library in various scenarios, especially those involving multilingual content.

The control methods, shared between `Controller` and `MultiLangStringControl`, provide the mechanisms to set, retrieve, and reset these flags. These methods ensure that you can dynamically configure the behavior of the library to suit your application's needs. We will explore each method in detail, providing insights into their usage and impact on the library's functionality.

The LangString and MultiLangString classes use a set of flags to control various aspects of their behavior. These flags are managed by `Controller` and `MultiLangStringControl` respectively. The flags provide a flexible way to customize the behavior of LangString and `MultiLangString` classes according to the specific needs of your application. By adjusting these flags, you can enforce different levels of validation and control over the language data being processed. The available flags and their effects are as follows.

The Control classes, namely `Controller` and `MultiLangStringControl`, act as static managers for the flags. They provide methods to set, retrieve, and reset the states of these flags, ensuring consistent behavior across all instances of LangString and `MultiLangString`.
