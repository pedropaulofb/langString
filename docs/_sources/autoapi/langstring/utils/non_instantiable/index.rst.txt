.. py:class:: NonInstantiable


   Bases: :py:obj:`type`

   A metaclass that prevents the instantiation of any class that uses it.

   When a class is defined with NonInstantiable as its metaclass, any attempt to instantiate that class will result
   in a TypeError. This is useful for creating classes that are meant to be used as namespaces or containers for
   static methods and class variables, without the intention of creating instances.

   Methods:
       __call__: Overrides the default call behavior to prevent instantiation.

   .. py:method:: __call__()

      Override the default call behavior to prevent instantiation of the class.

      When this method is called, it raises a TypeError, effectively preventing the creation of an instance of the
      class that uses NonInstantiable as its metaclass.

      :raises TypeError: Always, to indicate that the class cannot be instantiated.
