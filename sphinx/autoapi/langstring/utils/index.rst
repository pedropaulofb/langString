   The utils package provides internal utility functions and classes for the langstring package.

   This package includes various helper modules that support the core functionality of the langstring package,
   such as validation and non-instantiable class definitions. These utilities are intended for internal use only
   and should not be directly accessed by end users of the langstring package.

   Modules:
   --------

       - **non_instantiable**: Contains the NonInstantiable class which is used to prevent instantiation of certain
         classes.

       - **validators**: Provides validation functions for language strings and other components within the
         langstring package.
